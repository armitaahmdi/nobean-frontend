# Admin Dashboard Dynamic Implementation

## Overview
The admin dashboard has been updated to fetch data dynamically from the API instead of using static mock data. This implementation includes user statistics, test statistics, and exam attempt data.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Services (`src/services/dashboardApi.js`)
- Created new API service for dashboard data fetching
- Includes methods for:
  - `getDashboardStats()` - Combined dashboard statistics
  - `getUserStats()` - User statistics
  - `getTestStats()` - Test statistics  
  - `getExamAttemptsStats()` - Exam attempt statistics
  - `getRecentUsers()` - Recent user registrations
  - `getRecentActivities()` - Recent exam attempts

### 2. Redux State Management (`src/features/admin/slices/dashboardSlice.js`)
- Created new Redux slice for dashboard state management
- Includes async thunks for data fetching
- State includes:
  - Dashboard statistics
  - User statistics
  - Test statistics
  - Recent users and activities
  - Loading states and error handling

### 3. Updated Components

#### Dashboard Component (`src/pages/admin/Dashboard.jsx`)
- Replaced static data with dynamic API calls
- Added loading and error states
- Integrated with Redux store for state management

#### RecentUsersTable Component (`src/features/admin/components/tables/RecentUsersTable.jsx`)
- Updated to use dynamic user data from Redux store
- Improved user name display logic

#### ActivityFeed Component (`src/features/admin/components/ActivityFeed.jsx`)
- Updated to display real exam attempt activities
- Replaced mock data with dynamic API data

### 4. Backend Routes
- Added admin routes for exam attempts: `/api/v1/admin/tests/attempts`
- Updated server configuration to include admin test routes

### 5. Store Configuration
- Added dashboard reducer to Redux store
- Updated admin slices exports

## API Endpoints Used

### User Statistics
- `GET /api/v1/admin/users/stats` - User statistics
- `GET /api/v1/admin/users` - User list with pagination

### Test Statistics  
- `GET /api/v1/tests` - All tests
- `GET /api/v1/admin/tests/attempts` - All exam attempts
- `GET /api/v1/tests/{id}/statistics` - Specific test statistics
- `GET /api/v1/tests/{id}/results` - Test results

## Features

### Dashboard Statistics Cards
- Total users count
- Total tests count
- Total exam attempts
- Active users count
- Test completion rates
- Average scores

### Recent Activity Feed
- Recent exam completions
- User registration activities
- Filterable by activity type

### Recent Users Table
- Latest user registrations
- User details with registration dates
- Link to full user management

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Loading states for better UX
- Error messages displayed to users
- Automatic error clearing on component unmount

## Authentication
- All API calls require admin authentication
- Token-based authentication using JWT
- Admin role validation for sensitive operations

## Usage

The dashboard will automatically load data when:
1. User is authenticated as admin
2. Component mounts
3. Token is available

Data is cached in Redux store and will be refreshed on component remount or manual refresh.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Data refresh intervals
- Export functionality for statistics
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Chart data integration for visual analytics
